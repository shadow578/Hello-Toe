# Java Tic-Tac-Toe
kinda crappy Tic Tac Toe game written as a Java desktop application.

## Disclaimer
This is crappy, and you should __NOT__ try to learn from it.
This is why:
- I'm not really familiar with (desktop) java, so there will be a lot of dumb things in code
- DummyBot is really dumb and would walk into walls, if it could

Tho all this is still better than most things written in python ;)
